# Space Shooter: A three-level OpenGL game with final walk-home cutscene

## 1. Project Summary

A simple, fun space shooter where the player controls a plane, fights waves of enemy planes, and defeats one boss per level. The game has three progressively harder levels. Each level changes background and enemies. After finishing level three, the player exits the plane and walks toward a house in a short finishing scene. The main menu includes: New Game, Load Game, Leaderboard, Help, and Exit.

## 2. Objectives

* Design and implement a playable OpenGL space shooter.
* Create three distinct levels with unique enemies and one boss each.
* Add a main menu with game management (load/save) and leaderboard.
* Implement a final non-combat finishing scene where the character walks home.
* Deliver playable build, source code, and documentation.

## 3. Scope and Features

**Core gameplay**

* Player plane: move left/right/up/down, fire bullets, limited lives/health.
* Enemy waves: different enemy types per level that follow simple movement patterns.
* Boss fights: one boss per level with special attacks and higher health.
* Power-ups: temporary shield, rapid fire, health restore.
* Scoring: points for destroying enemies and bosses.
* Save/Load: store player progress and high scores in a file.

**Menu and UI**

* New Game: start fresh.
* Load Game: resume saved progress.
* Leaderboard: top scores with player names.
* Help: shows controls, scoring rules, and how to finish the game.
* Exit: close application.

**Finishing scene**

* After level three is cleared, show a short cutscene: the pilot exits the plane, walks along a small path, and reaches a house. This marks the game completion.

## 4. Technical Stack and Resources

**Languages and APIs**

* C++
* OpenGL for rendering

**Tools**

* IDE: Code::Blocks
* Git + GitHub for source control

## 5. Team Roles (6 members)

Suggested division of tasks so each member has clear responsibility:

1. ABTAHI ISLAM (23-50434-1): Complete Load Game, Leaderboard buttons. Make a logic and execute: "player exits the plane and walks toward a house."
   "Git Problem Solver"."Game Tester".
2. SHARIAR HASAN SIFAT (23-50674-1): Fully Complete game levels 1 and 2. Also design game over page."Git Problem Solver"."Game Tester".
3. ABIR HUSSAIN SHAH BIPU (22-49943-3): Plane movement logic, firing logic, health, and Point Counting and load history logic Implementation.
4. B. M. INTISAR TANJIM (23-50210-1): Resource collection and implementation. Also working on the instruction page. Also, properly complete help and exit buttons.
5. OSAMA MOBIN ZUHAR (22-49938-3): Plane movement logic, firing logic, health, and Point Counting and load history logic Implementation.
6. MD TAWHIDUL ISLAM (23-50206-1): Fully Complete game level 3 and ending scenario.

## 6. Conclusion

This proposal describes a clear, achievable plan to build a three-level OpenGL space shooter with a final finishing scene. The project keeps scope manageable while allowing visible creative features like changing backgrounds, bosses, and a small story ending. The six-member team has clear responsibilities to get a polished playable game within the planned phases.
